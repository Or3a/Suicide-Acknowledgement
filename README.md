# Suicide-Acknowledgement


Language: R

Suicide is one of those topics we are afraid to discuss.
This cannot be treated lightly, and even less from a data analysis point of view.
It is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, 
including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media.
These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.

In this notebook I am attempting to show how these factors actually impact the Suicide numbers.

After viewing a lot of examples, I stumbled upon this data set, which had everything I needed.The other ones where mostly the same but seperated, so this easies things out.

Some of the main elements this dataset is focused on

> Human Development <br>

> Absence of social support systems<br>
> Health<br>
> Life and Fertility<br>

Etc.
